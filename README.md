===============================

These are the sources from which I guided myself to complete this project:

* <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/canvas/notearsgame/">HTML5 canvas game tutorial (with collision detection)</a>

* <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Head-First-JavaScript-Programming-Freeman/dp/144934013X">Head First Javascript Programming (2004)</a>

* <a href="http://wickedlysmart.com/category/podcast/">

* As always, the main place from where I received help for this project were the piazza forums. (In particular, <a href="https://piazza.com/class/i0sf6tsmg0r7do?cid=1211">this post</a>)
